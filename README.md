## API

All APIs are implemented using the **Axios** HTTP client. This module comes already integrated with Nuxt and allows us to easily create REST APIs to allow us the fetching of DB resources from the front-end.

## Components

Most pages are built by assembling components toghether (see Design document commented wireframes for more details). This approach promotes code reusability and better organization, resulting in easier mantainance.

## DB Design

Below is the ER diagram we designed

## Framework functionalities

Most of the framework functionalities have been used like for example Layouts (also the built in functionality for the error page management), dynamic pages, components, Nuxt-Links.

## Best practices

We used most of the special directories

### `assets`

### `components`

### `layouts`

### `pages`

### `static`
